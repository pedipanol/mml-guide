# General MML

While MML formats and syntaxes can't be 100% compatible with each other, there is a common core among most of them, since they derive from the same basis and from each other.

This section will teach you general information that (at least in concept) will apply to 90% of the MML formats out there, so even though each format will diverge in its own, this guide at the very least will help you get the gist of it, to the point you can figure out the specifics on your own.
