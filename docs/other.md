# List of MML Music Drivers

While I'm keen on eventually covering a variety of specific MML formats the same way I did for PMD, it'll take time. As most of the lists of MML formats are kind of outdated or incomplete, I think it's worth at least making a an updated one.

If there's anything new or missing, do inform me.
